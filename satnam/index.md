# Silver Oak
I work at [Google Research](https://research.google/) on the [Silver Oak](https://github.com/project-oak/oak-hardware) project that is investigating
new ways of designing high assurance hardware and software based
on a methodology that starts from specifications and implementations
in the [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr) theorem prover cast in its dependently typed language
[Gallina](https://coq.github.io/doc/v8.9/refman/language/gallina-specification-language.html). We follow an approach inspired by the vision set out by
[Adam Chlipala](http://adam.chlipala.net) at MIT in his book
[Certified Programming with Dependent Types](http://adam.chlipala.net/cpdt/).
